# üöÄ Game Jam: "Nothing Can Go Wrong"

## üéØ Game Concept
A 2D Unity game with a launcher-style mechanic, where two characters try to reach an island using upgrades like gliders and propulsion systems. The game features obstacles such as birds and air mines. The art style is simplified using Piskel.

## ‚è≥ Development Timeline (1 Week)

### **Day 1: Core Physics & Launch System**
- [x] Implement a basic cannon launch system
- [x] Ensure physics-based trajectory and movement
- [x] Character should move naturally and slide upon landing
- [x] Basic UI
  - [x] Speed Tracker
  - [x] Height Tracker
  - [x] Distance Tracker
- [ ]  Basic Loop
  - [x]  when speed is zero the player stands up
  - [ ]  stats canvas
  - [ ]  click to restart
- [ ]  Basic xp tracking ((distance + height) * duration multiplier)

### **Day 2: Visuals & Animation**
- [ ] Implement basic cannon movement and animation
- [ ] Add player ragdoll effect upon launch
- [ ] Air Mines

### **Day 3: Obstacles**
- [ ] Implement birds, and other obstacles
- [ ] Ensure obstacles interact properly with physics and player movement

### **Day 4: Upgrade System**
- [ ] Implement upgrade mechanics
  - [ ] Cannon Force
  - [ ] Cannon Charge Rate
  - [ ] Player strength (getting through obsticles and obsticles impact)
  - [ ] Aero Dynamics
- [ ] Add upgrade art for glider and propulsion systems

### **Day 5: GUI & User Interaction**
- [ ] Build UI for menus, upgrade selection, and game status
- [ ] Implement visual and audio feedback for player actions

### **Day 6: Storyline & Instructions**
- [ ] Create a short storyline for context
- [ ] Implement tutorial/instruction system

### **Day 7: Final Touches & Submission**
- [ ] Set up itch.io page
- [ ] Minor polishing and bug fixes
- [ ] Final playtesting and submission
