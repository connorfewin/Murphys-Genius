# üöÄ Game Jam: "Nothing Can Go Wrong"

## üéØ Game Concept
A 2D Unity game with a launcher-style mechanic, where two characters try to reach an island using upgrades like gliders and propulsion systems. The game features obstacles such as birds and air mines. The art style is simplified using Piskel.

## ‚è≥ Development Timeline (1 Week)

### **Day 1: Core Physics & Launch System**
- [x] Implement a basic cannon launch system
- [x] Ensure physics-based trajectory and movement
- [x] Character should move naturally and slide upon landing
- [x] Basic UI
  - [x] Speed Tracker
  - [x] Height Tracker
  - [x] Distance Tracker
- [x]  Basic Loop
  - [x]  when speed is zero the player stands up
  - [x]  stats canvas
  - [x]  click to restart
- [x]  Basic xp tracking ((distance + height) * duration multiplier)

### **Day 2: Upgrade System and flying mechanics**
- [x] Basic Upgrade System & UI
  - [x] Cannon Force
- [ ] Particle Trail 
- [ ] Aero Mechanics
  - [ ] Add to UI
- [ ] Glider Mechanics
  - [ ] Basic glider art
  - [ ] Basic glider controls/movmeent in air
  - [ ] Appropriate speed adjustment

### **Day 3: Obstacles**
- [ ] Air Mines
  - [ ] Force emmited at an x degree increase to the current direction
- [ ] Birds (Just cause damage to glider and a speed hit) 

### **Day 4: Art**
- [ ] Cannon Sprite
- [ ] Glider Sprite
- [ ] Background art
  - [ ] Environment back ground
  - [ ] Environment middle ground
  - [ ] Different scrolling speeds for each
- [ ] Altitude Art
  - [ ] Different looks the higher you are 

### **Day 5: Game Juice**
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Sound Effects
- [ ] Art Polishing
- [ ] Camera Shake
  - [ ] Explosions
  - [ ] High Velocity 

### **Day 6: Storyline & Instructions**
- [ ] Create a short storyline for context
- [ ] Implement tutorial/instruction system

### **Day 7: Final Touches & Submission**
- [ ] Set up itch.io page
- [ ] Minor polishing and bug fixes
- [ ] Final playtesting and submission

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity (WebGL build)
